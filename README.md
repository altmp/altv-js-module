# Official clientside JavaScript runtime for alt:V

## To build:  
Run `.\tools\build.bat` (Make sure to run this script from the main directory of the repo)
Or use the VSCode task
Built `altv-client-js.dll` is now inside `dist` directory (if build was successful)  

## To test:  
Get dev branch of alt:V client (download from https://altv.mp or change branch in `altv.cfg`)  
Place `altv-client-js.dll` into the `modules/altv-client-js` directory in the alt:V client folder. (You need to create these directories yourself)
Set `debug: true` in `altv.cfg`
